# Application Categories

Coroot allows you to organize your applications into custom groups called Application Categories. 
These act like scopes, helping you either hide certain applications or focus on specific ones more easily.

To configure Application Categories, go to the **Project Settings**, click on **Applications**, and adjust the 
built-in categories or create your own custom ones. 
Each category is defined by a set of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) in the `<namespace>/<application_name>` format.

Coroot also includes several pre-defined categories, such as monitoring and control-plane.

## Quick links
To make organizing your apps easier, Coroot allows you to define the category for an app directly on the service map:

... or application page:
