**Step #1: Installing ClickHouse**

```bash
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
curl -fsSL 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/rpm/lts/repodata/repomd.xml.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg] https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
sudo apt update
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y clickhouse-server clickhouse-client

```

**Step #2: Installing Prometheus**

Coroot requires Prometheus with support for Remote Write Receiver, which has been available since v2.25.0.

```bash
sudo apt install -y prometheus
sudo service prometheus start
```

Enable Remote Write Receiver in Prometheus by adding the `--enable-feature=remote-write-receiver` argument to the `/etc/default/prometheus` file:

```bash
# Set the command-line arguments to pass to the server.
# Due to shell escaping, to pass backslashes for regexes, you need to double
# them (\\d for \d). If running under systemd, you need to double them again
# (\\\\d to mean \d), and escape newlines too.
ARGS="--enable-feature=remote-write-receiver"
```

Restart Prometheus:

```bash
sudo service prometheus restart
```
