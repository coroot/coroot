Coroot's AI-based Root Cause Analysis is a powerful feature that automatically analyzes telemetry data, 
providing you with a list of possible causes for the incident in just a few seconds. It's not magic âœ¨, 
Coroot uses a model of your entire system, acting like an experienced engineer. 
It navigates through the graph of service dependencies to identify issues that are likely related to the incident.
